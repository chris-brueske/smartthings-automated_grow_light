# smartthings-automated_grow_light
This is a custom SmartThings SmartApp, written in the SmartThings' version of Groovy. The goal of this app is to allow a mulisensor to toggle a grow light on/off between user entered start and end times, and when the light level is below a certain user defined threshold.

This code needs to be tested and run in the SmartThings SmartApp editor which is located in the developer portal at www.SmartThings.com.
